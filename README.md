🎴 Poker Card Generator

A simple Poker Card Generator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Each time the page loads (or on a button click, if added), it displays a random playing card from a standard deck.

This is a great beginner‑friendly project that demonstrates DOM manipulation, randomness in JavaScript, and basic UI design.

💡 How It Works

The generator uses JavaScript to randomly pick:

A card value (Ace, 2–10, Jack, Queen, King)

A card suit (♠️, ♥️, ♦️, ♣️)

Then it updates the HTML to display the selected card with styling.

This project is a solid example of how to manipulate the DOM and apply dynamic UI changes with vanilla JavaScript.
